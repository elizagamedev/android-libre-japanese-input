/**
 * A proxy activity forwarding to another activity.
 *
 * This activity is used to switch target activity based on runtime configuration.
 * For example,
 * <ul>
 * <li>"Modern" preference screen vs "Classic" one, based on API level.
 * </ul>
 * This can be done by using string resources (defining destination activity by
 * string resources in preference XML file) except for launching from home screen,
 * which sees AndroidManifest.xml which cannot refer string resources.
 * In fact the initial motivation to introduce this class is to launch appropriate
 * preference activity from home screen.
 *
 * It is found that switching based on string resource is hard to test because
 * precise control is impossible.
 * Now {@link org.mozc.android.inputmethod.japanese.DependencyFactory.Dependency}
 * has been introduced so switching feature becomes dependent on it.
