/**
 * Mozc customized version of EasyMockSupport.
 *
 * There is a plan that EasyMock supports Android mocking based on dexmaker, as far as we know,
 * but it seems pending for a while. So, we have some minimum support focusing on Mozc.
 *
 * EasyMock has started to support EasyMockSupport in order to provide some convenient methods,
 * such as replayAll, resetAll and verifyAll, inside a test case since version 2.5.2.
 * The class also have a facet as a helper class to inject some customized mocking code,
 * which we can use for MechaMozc mocking code.
 *
 * An example usage of this class is as follows:
 * {@code
 * public class SomeTestClass extends InstrumentationTestCase {
 *   private EasyMockSupport mockSupport;
 *
 *   @Override
 *   protected void setUp() throws Exception {
 *     super.setUp();
 *     mockSupport = new MozcMockSupport(getInstrumentation());
 *   }
 *
 *   @Override
 *   protected void tearDown() throws Exception {
 *     mockSupport = null;
 *     super.tearDown();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void testSomething() {
 *     SomeClass mockInstance = mockSupport.createMock(SomeClass.class);
 *   }
 * }
 * }
 *
 *
